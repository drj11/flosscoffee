# Exercise simplepie

In a new CoffeePlay session type ```Studio Raphael``` to open the drawing
area. Then play around with ```piechart 200, 200, 150, [1, 1, 2, 3]```.
Use ```clear()``` to empty the drawing area.

Define ```simplepie``` to be a function that takes a single list as an
argument and draws the pie chart. ```simplepie``` should choose a fixed
position and size for the pie chart.

I've started it already, you just need to fill in the blanks:

    simplepie = (listArg) ->
      piechart __, __, __, __

    # test with:
    simplepie [1, 2, 9]

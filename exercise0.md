# Exercise first steps

Open http://drj11.github.com/coffeeplay in a browswer. I haven't really
had the time to check anything apart from Chrome, so that probably works
best.

Type stuff in the input box at the bottom. Press ↵. See what happens.

Type more stuff. Try different things.

Empty the box (which on my browser I can do by triple-clicking to select
everything, and then pressing the ← key), then type this:

    2+3*4

and press ↵.

What order does CoffeeScript evaluate the expression?

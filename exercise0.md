# Exercise first steps

Find a buddy and sit next to them, so you can see each other's screens.

Open http://drj11.github.com/coffeeplay in a browser (in Chrome if you
can).

Type stuff in the input box at the bottom. Press ↵. See what happens.
Type more stuff. Try different things.

Empty the box (which on my browser I can do by triple-clicking to select
everything, and then pressing the ← key), then type this:

    2+3*4

and press ↵.

In what order does CoffeeScript evaluate the expression?

Did you learn anything? Swop notes with your new buddy. Ask them what
they learned.

How to call a function:

    Date()
    Math.random()
    Math.random()*6
    Math.floor(Math.random()*6)
    Math.floor Math.random()*6 

Make an Array (aka list):

    [2, 3, 5]
    [1..10]
    [1, 'two', null, 2.2]

Array's have a length property:

    a = [6..9]
    a.length

And are indexed using square brackets:

    a[1]

Indexing off the end of an Array gives undefined:

    a[4]

Which is itself a value just like any other:

    undefined

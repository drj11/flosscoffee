# Quiz


## Rearrange the following lines into the correct program:

    # A CoffeeScript function that turns a singular into
      else
      if word.match /s$/
    # its plural form.
    pluralise = (word) ->
        return word + 'es'
        return word + 's'

## Do the same for this one:

    fibonacci = (x) ->
      return fibonacci(x-1) + fibonacci(x-2)
      return x if x < 2

## Write a comment to document this function:

    r = (l) ->
      N = l.length
      for i in [0..N-1]
        l[N-i..].concat l[..N-i-1]

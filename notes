# Learning objectives

Students will be able to write simple functions.

Students will be able to create a simplified wrapper for a more
general function.

will be able to write simple computations involving strings,
numbers, lists, objects.

will be able to do routine conversion from JSON string to
object.

will be able to call functions in a particular sequence to
achieve a particular result.

explain how variable scoping works.

document functions that they have not written.

# Exercise simplepie

The function call

    piechart 200, 200, 150, [1, 1, 2, 3]

draws a piechart of a reasonable size (150 pixels radius) in
the middle of the drawing area (x=200, y=200). Let's fix the
position and size, and create a function called ```simplepie``` that
takes a single list as an argument, and draws the piechart.
```simplepie``` should always draw the chart at x=200, y=200 and
of size 150 pixels radius.

I've started it already, you just need to fill in the blanks:

    simplepie = (listArg) ->
      piechart __, __, __, __

If you've written ```simplepie``` correctly, you should be able
to go:

    simplepie [1, 2, 9]

to get a piechart.


# Quiz


## Rearrange the following lines into the correct program:

    # A CoffeeScript function that turns a singular into
      else
      if word.match /s$/
    # its plural form.
    pluralise = (word) ->
        return word + 'es'
        return word + 's'

## Do the same for this one:

    fibonacci = (x) ->
      return fibonacci(x-1) + fibonacci(x-2)
      return x if x < 2

## Write a comment to document this function:

    r = (l) ->
      N = l.length
      for i in [0..N-1]
        l[N-i..].concat l[..N-i-1]
